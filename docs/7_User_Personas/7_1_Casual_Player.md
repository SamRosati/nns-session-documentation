![alt text](rhiannonSmile.jpg)

- **Name:** Sophie Smith

- **Occupation:** Marketing Coordinator
- **Location:** Kitsilano, Vancouver
- **Tech Proficiency:** High (Daily user of Instagram, TikTok, Hinge)

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Sophie plays volleyball for the "vibes" first and the sport second. She loves the beach culture—music, sunsets, and post-game drinks. She is decent enough to keep a rally going (B-level), but she's terrified of "hardcore" intense games where people yell about rules. She wants to be included but often feels awkward asking to join strangers.

### Behaviors

- **FOMO-driven:** Checks Instagram stories constantly to see where her friends are.
- **Visual:** Likes seeing photos of who played and who won, even if she wasn't there.
- **Notification-Sensitive:** Will turn off notifications if an app spams her, but wants *instant* alerts if invited to a game.
- **Non-Confrontational:** Hates handling cash or asking friends to Venmo her for court fees.

## Goals

1. **Social Connection:** Wants to meet new people and hang out with her current friends in a fun setting.
2. **Low Friction Play:** Wants to find a game on a Tuesday evening without sending 50 texts.
3. **Validation:** Enjoys seeing her "stats" go up (games played) even if she doesn't care about a Glicko rating. Wants to be tagged in photos.

## Pain Points

- **The "Group Chat" Mess:** Trying to coordinate 4 people via iMessage is a nightmare of "I can't make it" and silence.
- **Skill Gap Anxiety:** Showing up to a "pickup game" and realizing everyone is AA level and she's out of her depth.
- **Exclusion:** Seeing a group playing at the beach and wishing she knew them well enough to jump in.
- **Handling Money:** Hate owing people $5 for court rentals or forgetting to bring cash.

## Why NNS Session?

- **The "Feed":** Sees her friends played a game yesterday. FOMO drives her to open the app.
- **"Sessions" Feature:** Can see exactly who is attending a pickup game and their "vibe" (rating) before she commits, reducing anxiety.
- **Follow System:** Follows the "cool" organizers so she never misses a fun sunset session invite.
