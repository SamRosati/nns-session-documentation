# 7.2 User Persona: The Semi-Pro Athlete

## Profile

- **Name:** Tyler Kowalski
- **Age:** 23
- **Occupation:** Personal Trainer / Student
- **Location:** Santa Monica, CA (or serious Vancouver scene)
- **Tech Proficiency:** Moderate. Uses apps for utility (workouts, nutrition, scheduling).

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Tyler is hungry. He believes he has what it takes to go pro (AVP/FIVB) but is currently stuck in the "King of the Beach" grind. He treats every match like a job interview. He is obsessed with data—win rates, point differentials, and who beat whom. He gets frustrated when "casuals" ruin the quality of a practice session.

### Behaviors

- **Competitive:** Will argue a call if it matters for the score.
- **Networker:** Always looking for a better partner (the "ladder" mentality).
- **Analytical:** Checks his rating daily. Wants to know *why* it went down.
- **Hustler:** Plays in 3 different tournaments a weekend if he can afford it.

## Goals

1. **Visibility:** Wants higher-rated players and organizers to know his name.
2. **Skill Quantification:** Needs a "Verified Rating" to prove to a potential A-level partner that he is worthy.
3. **Progression:** Wants a clear path: "If I win this tournament, I qualify for the Pro division."

## Pain Points

- **Rating Stagnation:** Using systems that don't differentiate between beating a novice 21-0 and beating a pro 21-19.
- **Partner Flakiness:** Having a partner drop out last minute without a replacement of equal skill.
- **Platform Fragmentation:** Having stats scattered across spreadsheet A, website B, and a notebook.

- **Unverified Coaching:** Paying for a clinic and realizing the coach knows less than he does.

## Why NNS Session?

- **Elo/Glicko System:** Loves that NNS tracks *point differential* and *strength of schedule*. His rating feels earned.
- **Partner Finder:** Uses the app to scout partners by filtering for "Rating > 1800".
- **Verified Results:** Likes that match results are "official" and build his permanent record (resume).
