# 7.7 User Persona: The Independent Coach

## Profile

- **Name:** Kelly Johnson
- **Age:** 28
- **Occupation:** Volleyball Coach / Part-time Server
- **Location:** Urban Beach Hub (e.g., Toronto, Chicago)
- **Tech Proficiency:** Moderate. Living on phone managing clients.

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Kelly is a former university player who loves teaching. She has a high volleyball IQ but struggles with the "business" side of coaching. She relies on word-of-mouth. She wants to be taken seriously as a professional service provider, not just "someone with a ball bag."

### Behaviors

- **Patient Teacher:** Loves seeing players have "aha" moments.
- **Hustler:** Running 3 clinics a day on weekends to make rent.
- **Reputation Guardian:** Her name is her brand. Bad reviews (or no reviews) kill her business.

## Goals

1. **Fill Capacity:** An empty spot in a clinic is lost revenue that can never be recovered.
2. **Credibility:** Wants to prove her students get better (data-backed coaching).
3. **Streamlined Admin:** Hates text threads: "Are you coming at 4 or 5?", "Can I pay cash?".

## Pain Points

- **Discovery:** How do new players find her? Instagram algorithm is fickle.
- **Skill Mismatches:** Students signing up for "Advanced" classes when they are Beginners, ruining the flow.
- **Feedback Loop:** Hard to give written feedback to 12 students after a session.

## Why NNS Session?

- **The "Rating Loop":** She can exclusively market "Rated Clinics"—if you take her class, you get an official NNS rating. This is a huge hook for players.
- **Rating Gating:** She can set her "Advanced Spiking" clinic to *require* an NNS rating of 2500+, ensuring high-quality reps.
- **Business in a Box:** Payments, liability waivers, and roster management are all handled in the specific "Clinic" session type.
