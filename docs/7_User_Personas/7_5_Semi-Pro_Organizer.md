# User Persona: The Semi-Pro Organizer

## Profile

- **Name:** Marcus Zhao
- **Age:** 34
- **Occupation:** Entrepreneur / League Owner
- **Location:** Regional Hub (e.g., Seattle, Denver)
- **Tech Proficiency:** High. Uses CRMs, Mailchimp, and spreadsheets aggressively.

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Marcus isn't just running a tournament; he's building a *brand*. He wants his local league to be the "premier" place to play in the city. He is ambitious and competitive with other local leagues. He cares deeply about "production value"—music, tents, prizes, and social media presence. He is transitioning from "side gig" to "full-time business."

### Behaviors

- **Community Builder:** Actively recruits sponsors (local breweries, physio clinics).
- **Data Driven:** Wants to know retention rates. "Why didn't Sarah sign up this month?"
- **Content Creator:** Hired a photographer for the finals. Posts highlight reels.

## Goals

1. **Growth:** Scale from 20 teams to 50 teams per weekend.
2. **Monetization:** Move beyond just entry fees—wants to sell merch, sponsorships, and memberships.
3. **Legitimacy:** Wants his events to feel professional, even if the players are local amateurs.

## Pain Points

- **Fragmentation:** Managing registrations on one site, payments on Venmo, and brackets on paper is unscalable.
- **Checkout Friction:** Every step a player has to take to register is a chance for them to bail. Needs a sleek checkout.
- **Sponsor Reporting:** Cannot prove to the local brewery that their $500 sponsorship got any eyeballs.

## Why NNS Session?

- **Organization Pages:** Loves that NNS lets him have a "Company Page" where players can follow his brand specifically.
- **The "Feed" as Marketing:** When a player gets a verified result from his tournament, it shows up in *their* feed, advertising Marcus's league to all their friends. Free viral marketing.
- **Sponsor Integration:** Can put sponsor logos on the digital leaderboard that every player checks 50 times a day.
