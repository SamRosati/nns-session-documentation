![alt text](../assets/hamishBlockSignals.jpg)

- **Name:** Chris "Community" Lee
- **Age:** 29
- **Occupation:** Software Engineer
- **Location:** Kitsilano, Vancouver
- **Tech Proficiency:** High. Expects software to be intuitive and bug-free.

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Chris loves volleyball and wants to build a community. He organizes the "Sunday Funday" tournament series. It's a passion project, but he hates losing money on it. He does this on evenings and weekends, so he has zero tolerance for manual data entry or time-wasting tasks.

### Behaviors

- **Spreadsheet Warrior:** Currently runs everything on Google Sheets because other apps are too expensive or clunky.
- **Community Leader:** Everyone knows him; he's the "guy with the clipboard."
- **Stressed:** Worries about rain, no-shows, and chargebacks.

## Goals

1. **Break Even / Small Profit:** Wants to cover permit costs and buy a few beers without going into debt.
2. **Efficiency:** Wants a "one-click" bracket generator.
3. **Good Vibes:** Wants players to be happy and know where to go without asking him 100 times.

## Pain Points

- **Chasing Payments:** "I'll e-transfer you later" is his trigger phrase.
- **No-Shows:** People signing up and not coming ruin the bracket.
- **Communication:** sending emails, text blasts, and FB posts to update a start time.
- **Seeding Nightmares:** Spending Friday night manually ranking 32 teams based on hearsay.

## Why NNS Session?

- **Stripe Integration:** Players *must* pay to register. No cash, no IOUs.
- **Automated Seeding:** NNS uses the Glicko ratings to seed the bracket automatically. Chris gets his Friday night back.
- **Push Notifications:** One button to notify all 64 players "Rain delay - 30 mins."
