# Week 1 #

## What were you tasked to do? ##

During the 2nd term of my Full Stack Web Development Program at BCIT, I was tasked to go through the UX / UI design process for either rebuilding an existing website, or building an idea of my own.

## How did you do it? ##

Since I have an idea for a web app that I am very passionate about building, it was an easy decision for me to choose the option of building out my own idea. I am a highly active member in Vancouver's beach volleyball community, and after having built a brand/tournament series for the community, I learned that there are obvious gaps in the market that could be solved through a well designed web app.

## Idea you created (add images) ##

In order to explain the idea I created, I think it makes most sense to explain the problem that I noticed.

### The Problem ###

In the beach volleyball community in Vancouver, there are several different organizations spanning from **very casual** (group chats with a few friends) to **very formal** (official provincial organization). The official organizations have legacy software that they use to register players for their tournaments, however the system has terrible UI / UX design, and it doesn't solve any of the actual tournament-day automation.

Although solving the registration aspect for tournaments is valuable, there is much more that can be done to make running tournaments less frustrating and free up time for organizers to focus on challenges that can't be automated. For example, automating the process of seeding players that register for a given tournament, creating the round robin match ups, creating the playoff brackets, results tracking, etc...

## why you chose this ##

I chose to pursue building a volleyball tournament automation software for a few different reasons:

- I started running my own tournament series in 2024, and I realized that taking registrations and running tournaments using pen & paper is difficult, time consuming and involved doing repetitive work that could be automated.

- I noticed that many other tournament organizers were struggling with the same problems.

- I saw this problem as a perfect opportunity to develop new skills as a software engineer and potentially start a business while doing so.

## Are you working alone or in a team? Why? ##

I'm working alone because the problem I'm trying to tackle requires a significant amount of knowledge, experience and connections in the volleyball community that I have, and my class mates don't necessarily have. I believe that working in a group at this stage of the project would be counterproductive. Once I have built out the first version of the software successfully and prove out the business model, I would be interested in involving more people in the project.

## What do you hope to get out of the class/es ##

I hope to achieve a few things:

- Learn how to follow a methodic approach to creating a complex piece of software to solve a complex problem

- End up with a non-trivial software product on my portfolio that demonstrates my ability to create value in the world of information technology.
