# 1.2 Background & Context

## Origin Story

![alt text](image.png)

In 2022, I moved to Vancouver and immediately fell in love with the vibrant beach volleyball community. As I spent more time on the sand, I became deeply involved, not just as a player but as a community builder. I started a brand and began hosting my own tournament series.

Through this experience, I saw the community grow firsthand. Hosting tournaments and handing out merchandise as prizes helped foster a strong sense of connection and excitement. However, as the tournaments grew, so did the logistical challenges.

## The Catalyst

I quickly realized that the operational side of beach volleyball was stuck in the past.

- **Manual Processes**: I found myself—and other organizers—relying on pen and paper or basic spreadsheets to manage tournaments.
- **Legacy Software**: The few existing software solutions used by leagues and organizations were outdated, with poor UI/UX.
- **Inefficiencies**: Essential tasks like registration, waitlist tracking, and scorekeeping were cumbersome and prone to error.

It became clear that the volleyball community needed a modern software platform for effective data organization. But beyond just logistics, I saw a massive potential for a **social platform** to further grow the sport. There was a missing link that could connect athletes with coaches, organizers, and each other in a meaningful way.

## The Vision

I decided to create **NNS Session** to bridge these gaps.

## The Problem

Existing official organizations use legacy software that frustrates users with poor design and fails to address tournament-day automation. Organizers are bogged down by repetitive tasks that should be automated, such as:

- Seeding players and creating match-ups.
- Managing playoff brackets.
- Tracking results and compiling statistics.
- Enabling players to carry standardized points between different tournament series.

## The Proposed Solution

NNS Session is a software platform designed to organize data for the volleyball community while connecting athletes, organizers, and coaches.

**Phase 1: Organizer Tools**
The initial focus is to build a robust tool that saves organizers time by automating:

- Registrations and pool creation.
- Seeding and playoff bracket generation.
- Mobile score entry for players (eliminating the need to chase down paper scoresheets).
- Data tracking for wins, losses, and player statistics.

**Phase 2: Athlete & Coach Connection**
Once the core tournament automation is established, the platform will expand to:

- Connect athletes with each other and with coaches.
- Implement a standardized point system for competitive players aspiring to semi-pro or professional levels (FIVB, VolleyballBC).
- Provide coaches with a platform to post clinics, run their businesses, and earn verified ratings from athletes.

## Why Build This?

I chose to pursue this project because it perfectly intersects my passion for beach volleyball with my desire to solve real-world problems through software. I have felt the pain of manual tournament management firsthand, and I know that a well-designed, community-focused platform can revolutionize how the sport is organized and experienced in Vancouver and beyond.
