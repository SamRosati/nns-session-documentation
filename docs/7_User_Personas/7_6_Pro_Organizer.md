# 7.6 User Persona: The World Tour Director (Pro Organizer)

## Profile

**Name:** Dan Reynolds
**Age:** 45
**Occupation:** International Event Director (FIVB / AVP)
**Location:** Global (Gstaad, Rio, Doha)
**Tech Proficiency:** Low to Moderate. Relies on staff. "It just needs to work on TV."

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Dan operates at the highest level. We are talking stadiums, TV broadcast rights, and Olympic qualification points. Scale is massive. His "customers" are not just players, but the International Federation, TV networks, and massive corporate sponsors. He cannot afford a single glitch. Authenticity and formality are paramount.

### Behaviors

- **Risk Averse:** An app crash isn't an inconvenience; it's a breach of contract with ESPN/NBC.
- **Delegator:** Manages a staff of 50+. Needs tools that restrict what the "intern" can delete.
- **Formalist:** Needs adherence to strict international rulebooks (FIVB Technical Regulations).

## Goals

1. **Broadcast Reliability:** The live score on the app *must* match the TV broadcast instantly.
2. **Data Sovereignty:** Needs raw data export for official federation records (Olympic points).
3. **Tiered Access:** Needs specific views for "Referees," "Press," "VIPs," and "Medical Staff."

## Pain Points

- **Connectivity at Scale:** 5,000 fans in a stadium crush the cell towers. How do we keep the scores updated?
- **Complex Formats:** Pool play into Modified Double Elimination with Country Quota limits. Most apps can't handle the logic.
- **Liability:** Needs ironclad waivers and medical tracking integration.

## Why NNS Session?

- **Offline-First Architecture:** The dedicated "Ref Pad" mode works on a tablet with zero internet, syncing only when connection is restored. Critical for stadium reliability.
- **Advanced Rules Engine:** Configurable to handle complex FIVB "Lucky Loser" brackets and Country Quota restrictions.
- **API Access:** Can pipe real-time scoring data directly to the TV broadcast truck overlay system.
