## Profile

![alt text](image.png)

- **Name:** Melissa Humana-Peredes
- **Age:** 31
- **Occupation:** Professional Athlete
- **Location:** International Circuit
- **Tech Proficiency:** Functional. Uses social media for brand building, not just fun.

## Empathy Map

### Characteristics

Melissa is the pinnacle. She doesn't need to "find" games; games happen around her. Her time is her most valuable asset. She cares about *efficiency* and *brand*. She is often mobbed by fans or lower-level players wanting advice. She needs boundaries but also wants to give back (and monetize her expertise).

### Behaviors

- **Brand Conscious:** Everything she posts is curated.
- **Mentor Figure:** Occasionally runs high-level clinics to supplement income.
- **Exclusive:** Only plays with other pros to maintain top form.

## Goals

1. **Monetization:** Easy way to fill spots in her exclusive "Pro Clinics" without handling admin work.
2. **Fan Engagement:** Wants to interact with the local community without giving out her phone number.
3. **Legacy:** Wants her tournament wins recorded in history.

## Pain Points

- **Admin Overload:** Managing 20 DMs asking "Can you coach me?"
- **Privacy:** Doesn't want randos knowing exactly where she trains every day (needs "Private Sessions").
- **Data Accuracy:** Hates when tournament organizers spell her name wrong or lose the bracket data.

## Why NNS Session?

- **Pro Organizer Tools:** She can host a "Pro Clinic" on NNS, set a price, and let the app handle signups/payments.
- **Verification Authority:** She can be a "Super User" who *grants* verified ratings to others, cementing her status as an expert.
- **Privacy Controls:** Can create "Invite Only" sessions for her pro training group that don't appear on the public feed.
